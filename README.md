<h2 align="center">(AI based Condition Monitoring System for Yard Activities) <br><h2>

<h4>GSL has high valued facilities / assets such as ship lift & transfer system, LLC cranes, etc. which require a generic health monitoring & maintenance that can be used for all yard assets. It is required to acquire equipment health data continuously and autonomously from sensors, which are required to be installed on the equipment (for eg data like vibration acoustics, temperature, etc that provides insights into equipment health). Analyze overall health trends and identifying defects that occur at multiple durations of the equipment using machine and deep learning models. Smart & actionable alerts based on risk and fault is required to be provided by the algorithm, which will replace periodic maintenance to a condition based monitoring.</h4>
<h3>Challenge domain/Technology: <h4>Industrial<h4><h3>
<h3>Future Expectation from the prototype / Technology developed:<h4>Increase the lifetime and Reduce downtime of high valued assets such as ship lift & transfer system andLLC cranes by planned preventive maintenance.<h4>
